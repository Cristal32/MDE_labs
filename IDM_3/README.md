# Graphical editor with Sirius

The aim of this work is the creation of a Domain-Specific Graphical Modeling
Workbench with Eclipse Technologies. It summarizes the presentation of Obeoâ€™s team during the International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (Models 2016) that has been held in Saint-Malo, France.

## Sirius concepts

During this workshop, we will mainly use these Sirius concepts:
- **Viewpoint Specification Project**
    - The Eclipse project that defines a Sirius modeling tool
    - Contains an `odesign` file that describes the representations and Java services used by the tool

- **Viewpoint**
    - A viewpoint defines Sirius representations (diagrams, tables, matrices, trees) dedicated to a specific need

- **Diagram Description**
    - Describes a kind of graphical representation for our model
    - It defines which elements to display on the diagram, how (style) and the tools to edit them

- **Node**
    - Describes model elements displayed via an image or a simple shape
    - It defines how to find the model elements to display
    - It defines a graphical style (shape, label, color, ...)

- **Relation Based Edge**
    - Describes the relationship between two objects
    - The relationship can be computed
    - It defines graphical style (color, routing style, ...)

- **User Colors Palette**
    - Defines specific colors that you can use for the diagram elements (background, foreground, border, ...)

- **Container**
    - Describes graphical model elements that can contain other elements (as free form, lists or compartments)
    - Defines how to find the container elements to display and their sub- elements (nodes, containers, ports)
    - Defines a graphical style (shape, label, color, ...)

- **Double-Click tool**
    - Defines which actions to execute when the user double-click on a graphical element

- **Direct Edit Label tool**
    - Defines how to interpret the label value changes that are made directly on the diagram

- **Properties Views Description**
    - Describes how model element properties are edited in the Eclipse Properties Views

## Step1: Metamodel

### Objective
Use Ecore Tools to create a metamodel that allows the description of a robot
choregraphy:
- The Ecore model
- The generated Java source code corresponding to the EMF implementation
